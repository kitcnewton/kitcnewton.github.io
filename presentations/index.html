when giving the talk. These notes are <em>extremely</em> raw and unpolished. They

The group of special orthogonal matrices has the structure of a variety. This talk will focus on how certain geometric properties of this variety are related to the convergence of a particular algorithm for solving a low-rank semidefinite programing (SDP) problem. In particular, we provide a closed formula for the degree of SO(n), and show that from this one can count the number of critical points of this low-rank SDP problem. Additionally, I will discuss our computational work exploring the real locus of SO(n).This is based upon joint work with Madeline Brandt, Taylor Brysiewicz, Robert Krone, and Elina Robeva.

		Algebraic geometry is a massive forest, and it is often easy to become lost in the thicket of technical detail and seemingly endless abstraction. The goal of this talk is to take a step back out of these weeds, and return to our roots as algebraic geometers. By looking at three different classical problems we will explore various parts of algebraic geometry, and hopefully motivate the development of some of its larger machinery. Each problem will slowly build with no prerequisite assumed of the listener in the beginning.

This talk will not focus in any detail about these examples, but instead we will explore various ways we might approaching counting. In particular, I will try and convince you that keeping track of additional structure when counting often leads to more natural answers. This is based in part on Tom Leinster's <i>The Euler characteristic of a category</i>. Despite the title very little about category theory will be used, and the speaker will do their best to keep things down to Earth.

		Given a continuous map f:Xâ€”>X of topological spaces and a point x in X one can consider the set {x, f(x), f(f(x)), f(f(f(x))),â€¦} i.e, the orbit of x under the map f. The study of such things even in simple cases, for example when X is the complex numbers and f is a (quadratic) polynomial, turns out to be quite complex (pun sort of intended). (It also gives rise to main source of pretty pictures mathematicians put on posters.) In this talk I want to show how the study of such orbits is related to the following question: How can one tell if a (ramified) covering of S^2 comes from a rational function? No background will be assumed and there will be pretty pictures to stare at.

		Did the Universe come from nothing? Why are we moral? Where did we come from? According to some signs on Bascom Hill these are the important questions in life. Sadly the poor person who made these signs does not know what the really important questions are: What is David Zureick-Brown going to saying in his NTS talk? How many rational points are on the projective curve given (in affine coordinates) by: $$y^2 = x^6 + 8x^5 + 22x^4 + 22x^3 + 5x^2 + 6x + 1?$$ If you would like to be enlightened by the answers to these truly important questions come to my talk where everything will be illuminated... Or at least some of the background for Coleman and Chabauty's method for finding rational points on curves will be discussed. PS: The number of references to Elijah Wood will be bounded - just like the number of rational points on our curves.

		I will discuss how the classical Bertini Theorems fail over finite fields, and how similar results may be obtained in these settings. This will focus on Poonen's paper, <i>Bertini Theorems Over Finite Fields</i>.

		Given a finite set of numbers there are many different ways to measure the center of the set. Three of the more common are mean, median, mode familiar to us from high school. This talk will focus on the concept of the median, and why in many ways it's frigin' sweet. In particular, we will explore how we can extend the notion of a median to higher dimensions, and apply it to create more robust statistics. It will be awesome, and there will be donuts.

		A variety \(X\) over a field \(k\) is rational if it is birationally equivalent to \(\mathbb{P}^n\). The question of whether or not \(X\) is rational depends on the ground field in often subtle ways. In fact, it turns out that in some case this whether or not \(X\) is rational over \(k\) is equivalent to the existence of a smooth \(k\)-rational point. We will explore this connection by considering quadric and cubic hypersurfaces over various fields.

		The study of resolutions of singularities dates back to the 19th century when many very geometric methods of resolving singularities were developed. We will explore some of these by looking at the case of curves. Given time I will also discuss how these methods do and do not generalize to higher dimensional varieties.

		Given a polynomial \(f(z)\) with complex coefficients, we can ask for which complex numbers \(p\) is the set \(\{f(p), f(f(p)), f(f(f(p))),...\}\) bounded, that is to ask which complex numbers have bounded forward orbit under \(f(z)\)? Alternatively we can turn the question around and ask for a fixed complex number \(p\), for which (complex) polynomials is the forward orbit of \(p\) bounded? Finite? Periodic? These questions give the interesting fractal pictures many of you have probably seen. Amazingly many of the tools needed to approach these questions, arose well before computers allowed us to generate images like the one above. In this talk we will explore some of the basic tools and results of complex dynamics paying particular attention relations to number theory. The goal being to present some of the background material need for Laura DeMarco's talk later in the week. (Also getting to see a really cool area of mathematics!)

		The game of Hex is a two player game played on a hexagonal grid attributed in part to John Nash. (This is the game he is playing in <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>.) Despite being relatively easy to pick up, and pretty hard to master, this game has surprising connections to some interesting mathematics. This talk will introduce the game of Hex, and then explore some of these connections. *As it is a lot more fun once you've actually played Hex feel free to join me at 3:00pm on the 9th floor to actually play a few games of Hex!*
