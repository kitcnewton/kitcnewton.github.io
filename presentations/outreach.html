<h3>Outreach Presentations</h3>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> For many of my presentations I have included the notes I used
when giving the talk. These notes are <em>extremely</em> raw and unpolished. They 
almost surely contain many errors, typos, and mistakes; not to mention things that only 
make sense to me. So when reading them be catious and keep their context in mind.

As a high schooler I occasionally got bored, would zone out, and would doodle on my paper. Often repeatedly tracing around something on my paper creating doodles like this:
<br>
<img src="../img/doodle.jpg" alt="A Simple Doodle" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
<br> In this bored state my mind would often wander, and I would wonder about important things like "Will I have a date for prom?" or "What is the cafeteria serving for lunch?", but germane to this talk were my wonderings about, "What’s happening to the shape of this doodle?" It turns out that these idle daydreams and doodles provide a good taste for how mathematicians "do" math. We will start by doodling and asking questions, and then we'll see where these lead us mathematically.		</div>

		The goal of our station will be to explore the mathematics related to the games: Set, Nim, and Chomp. We will have stations where individuals can drop by play a few games and explore these games for themselves. (We will have worksheets and volunteers providing guidance.) Additionally, anyone will be able to challenge our Master of Nim with fun prizes available for beating them. (Note: This is at a special time and location.)

		When doing your math homework you probably spend most of your time staring a worksheet that has a bunch of concrete questions on it. When doing research mathematics rarely are you so lucky to have the such a sheet, and often the hardest part of research is isolating exactly the right question. The goal of this talk is to try and fid the write questions about two subjects: 1) the game of Hex and 2) crumpled paper.
