<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>
I frequently enjoy programming, most often working in either Macaulay2, MatLab, or HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, 
however, I also have some (quite limited) experience with Python and Sage. A few of the more substantive 
projects I have worked on include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="title"><a href="https://syzygydata.com">SyzygyData</a> - A numerical approach to syzygies of Veronese embeddings</span>
<br />with <span class="coauthor">Daniel Erman, Steve Goldstein, Jay Yang</span>
</li>

<br>

<li>
<span class="title"><a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2017-Berkeley/tree/master/PossibleBettiTables">PossibleBettiTables.m2</a> - Computing the family of all possible Betti tables of a 0-dimensional grade module</span>
<br />with <span class="coauthor">Mike Loper and Michael Perlman</span>
</li>

<br>

<li>
<span class="title"><a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~schwede/M2/PosChar.m2">PosChar.m2</a> - a package for positive characteristic methods in Macaulay2</span>
<br />with <span class="coauthor">Erin Bela,  Daniel J. Hern√°ndez, Zhibek Kadyrsizova, 
Moty Katzman, Sara Malec, Pedro Teixeira, Karl Schwede, and Emily Witt</span>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Snippets of Code & Programs</h3>
<p>When trying to understand a problem I often find it useful to look at a large number of examples. This often helps me understand both what I should be trying to prove, as well as how I should be trying to prove it. Frequently this means writing Macaulay2 code to compute various things. These are some of the snippets of code I figure might be interesting to others. (Full-Disclaimer: Most of this code is quite rough, and was written to accomplish specific goals I had in mind. So... it is probably not pretty, optimized, or polished.)</p>
