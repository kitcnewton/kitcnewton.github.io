<h3>Expository Writing</h3>
<p>I find writing to be the best way for me to really understand a subject. Something about writing makes me sort out and organize my thoughts, and so on my mathematical journey I have written a fair deal of notes about things -- mostly commutative algebra and algebraic geometry stuff. Someday I plan on going through these, posting the ones, which I think might be useful to others and are not too out of shape. Until I get around to doing this enjoy Eisenbud Cake!</p>
